This project is about a website which follows a three-tier architecture while also implementing
valuable practices and technologies, such as REST API for the "connection", JSON data when sending back
to the front, and so on.

The dataset used for the making of this website were found on data.gov.uk

How will it work?
- I will have the front built and then when a request happens to retrieve any info from the dataset or database,
then ENDPOINTS will be used. These endpoints will be made on the backend side using PHP.

- Basically, I will use PHP to build a REST API that will make and handle endpoints, and it will the
"connector" between the front end and the database.



<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

spl_autoload_register(function ($class) {
    require __DIR__ . "/src/$class.php";
});
var_dump($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"]);

// set_exception_handler("ErrorHandler::handleException");

header("Content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8");

$request_uri = $_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];

// Parse the request URL
$urlParts = explode("/", trim($request_uri, "/"));

// Check if the URL matches the expected structure
if ($urlParts[0] === 'index' && $urlParts[1] === 'datacol' && isset($urlParts[2])) {
    // Extract the ID from the URL
    $id = $urlParts[2];
    
    // Handle the request based on the extracted ID
    $controller = new DataController();
    $controller->sendResponse(["Handling request for datacol with ID $id", 200]);
    exit;
} else {
    // If the URL doesn't match the expected structure, return an error response
    $controller = new DataController();
    $controller->sendResponse(["Unsupported URL!", 405]);
    http_response_code(405);
    exit;
}

?>
